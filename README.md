# R909-VFO
To remodel the convensional analog radio kits, the digital VFO is nesessary. 
I derived such VFO circuit PCB from the DSP radio design of R909-DSP.
R909-DSP is composed with Arduino-Si5351a of the panel-PCB and TA2003-Si4732 of RF-PCB.
The panel-PCB was designed to be installed in 88x38x70 aluminum case.
I will introduce the schematic, Arduino sketch, and case installation for R909-VFO.
